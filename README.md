# Poor Man's CMS (pmcms)

... a very basic CMS generating static html pages.

pmcms is distributed under the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) and [MPL](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html) Open Source licenses. This **dual copyleft licensing model** is flexible and allows you to choose the license that is best suited for your needs. The Open Source licenses are intended for:

* Integrating pmcms into Open Source software.
* Personal and educational use of pmcms.
* Integrating pmcms in commercial software while at the same time satisfying the terms of the Open Source license.

**Hint:** pmcmns is a further development of the [good old Poor Man's CMS](http://poormans.sourceforge.net/). It's currently an
early-state project and isn't runnable at the moment!
